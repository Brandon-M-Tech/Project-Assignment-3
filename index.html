      <p class="text_column">I live in a remote mining town 16 hours drive North of Perth, W.A called Tom Price. Currently working as a haul truck driver. I’m a dog groomer by trade, dogs are a massive part of my life and I am a dog mum of 3. I.T is another passion of mine and I am very keen to start a career in this field. My interest started in I.T at around the age of 14, my parents bought me my first laptop and I would spend hours on MySpace creating and writing HTML for my page. I love all things about technology but my main interests revolve around I.T support and web/software design.</p>
